//An institution admin can set a blood unit as used in patients or as discarded (by health check or expiry date).
//The contract will update the donor and the institution inventory records.
//If the blood unit was used, extra rewards in the form of tokens will be issued to the donor by executing a CPI into the token program, proportional to the demand value.
//A Blood Unit Used event will be issued with the relevant data.
