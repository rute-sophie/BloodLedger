# BloodLedger ü©∏üè•

This is my turbin3 capstone project called BloodLedger.
BloodLedger is a decentralised Blood Donation Management System in Solana where healthcare professionals can have real-time access to blood inventory data (e.g., blood types and their availability) with tokenized incentives for donors. 

The goals are to help shortage by boosting donor engagement with a recognition system, enhance security by protecting sensitive donor and patient data using encrypted storage in solana blockchain, and to ensure timely access to blood supplies
